# Pillow App
A project for Database Management System at Northeastern University Seattle. 

## Value Proposition:
Pillow is a rental app that streamlines the process of renting a house, apartment, or room by providing landlords access to applicants with pre-approved credit scores and background checks, and renters with an easy application process that stores past rental information for later applications, reducing redundant paperwork and creating less stress for both tenants and landlords. This app is for individual property owners and renters who are dissatisfied with cumbersome and repetitive rental process and the impermanence of apps like AirBnb and VRBO.
